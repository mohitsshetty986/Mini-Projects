## The youtubeVideo python file is the core of this project.

## Mainly two functions are created that,

1. Takes youtube video URL and downloads and stores it in the static folder.
2. Converts the downloaded mp4 file to mp3 format.

## **We create two different folders-**

1. &quot; **static&quot;** folder is where the downloaded video mp4 file and the converted mp3 file be stored.
2. &quot; **templates&quot;** folder has the html file for this project.

## **We run the python file in terminal**

## As shown in the image to get the project interface we go to localhost: **127.0.0.1:5000** and we get the below web page displayed

## As shown we have to type the URL of a youtube video to download it and the downloaded video will be displayed in the black region below.

We enter the URL in the search bar:

## **Now if you want to convert it into an mp3 file for example:**

If someone wants to download a song and does not want a video but just the audio then after downloading the YouTube video, he can press the &quot; **convert video to mp3**&quot; button to convert it to mp3 file and can delete the mp4 file after the **mp3 file is downloaded** in the same &quot; **Static**&quot; folder.

## **As you can see the video and the mp3 file have been stored in static folder.**

## **Now if you want to convert the mp4 into image frames (fps=1):**

Say if you want few image clips of a very famous actor/actress in the video, press the **Convert video to image frames**.
